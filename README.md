# Helper files for next.py Course Exercises

## About
[Campus-IL's **next.py** course](https://campus.gov.il/course/course-v1-cs-gov-cs-nextpy102/) is a free Python massive 
open online course. It has a lot of exercises, many of them are "open" Python code writing tasks. These exercises are 
not checked by anybody or anything (except final project, and only for paid upgrade). 

As it is common to only partially fulfill the exercise requirement, and that students may not know how to test their 
solutions, having a pre-ready exercises and test framework, may help them.
